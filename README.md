# leverage

Done as part of the final round of [Unilever's  hackathon](https://uniquelyunilever.com/fllhackathon).

This is a simple mockup of a web app proposed to improve the livelihood of hawkers in developing countries by

1. incentivising loyal customers to help generate a digital presence
2. provide simple dashboards and data for hawkers to improve their offerings
3. connect directly with unilever's product market to incentivise them to use unilever products.

Even though we did not win this hackathon, the concept of digitising developing countries is highly challenging. The basis of it is entirely dependent on infrastructural issues and user adoption.
